**Intro**

Built to display the beauty of travel and share what adventures we can all get even just here in the United States. A way to share, collaborate, explore all threw a webpage built for simplicity yet efficiency. Using key fundamentals of HTML CSS and expanding on them in a unique way this sight is meant as a connection to others and a display of my growing skill with web design.
